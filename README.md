# Bulgarian History for Android

This is an app that I have made which can be found [HERE](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nmp90.bghistory). It is called "История на България" and it contains summary of the Bulgarian history from 681 until 2005. The summary is made from the history students book for 12 grade and some other sources.

## Functionalities

1. Search history events by year
2. Search history events by title
3. Get a summary of events and years
4. Short description of each event with result and leaders
5. Capitals list with Google Maps placement

## Database

The data is placed in [assets](./app/src/main/assets) folder. It contains the tables with the history information and capitals.
